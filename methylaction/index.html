    <h1>What is MethylAction?</h1>
    <p>MethylAction is an R package for detecting differentially methylated regions (DMRs) from enrichment-based techniques for sequencing DNA methlyation genome-wide. These techniques include <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19906696">MBD-isolated Genome Sequencing (MiGS)</a>, MBD-seq, and MeDIP-seq.</p>
    <p><h3>Key Features:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed for studies investigating biological and disease sub-types</li>
        <li>Supports comparisons between more than 2 groups (up to 8 tested by authors)</li>
        <li>Computes statistical significance across genomic regions</li>
        <li>Stratifies groups by consistency ("frequent" and "other" DMRs)</li>
        <li>Performs bootstrapping or permutations to establish false discovery rates (FDRs)</li>
        <li>Provides tools for visualization (heatmaps and karyograms)</li>
    </ul></p>
